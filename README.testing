The testing script generates certificates and sets up the following
- web server
- reliable site server
- oracle notary server
- oracle signing server
it then launches Firefox and Chrome and performs notarization.
The script can be launched on any OS (install OpenSSL-Win32 on Win and python3 on Win and OSX).


Before running the actual test, prepare the environment:

1. Make sure the dirs "pagesigner-unittests", "pagesigner-oracles" and "pagesigner" are in the same dir
2. Make sure Chrome is not running (including the background process systray icon)
3. Run python3 run-test.py
4. In Chrome install the helper app from the PageSigner menu.
5. In Firefox goto
	5.1 Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Certificates->View Certificates->Authorities->Import 
	and choose pagesigner-unittests/certs/rootCA.cert select Trust this CA to identify websites -> OK
	5.2 in about:config change xpinstall.signatures.required to false
	5.3 Tools->Add-ons->Extensions, enable PageSigner
6. On Linux and OSX terminate run-test.py with Ctrl+C (it will close Chrome and Firefox automatically). On Windows use Ctrl+Break and close browsers manually.

After preparing the environment, you can run the actual test:
python3 run-test.py 
The script exits with return code 0 on success, 1 on failure.


-----THE INFO BELOW IS RELEVANT ONLY IF YOU USE VIRTUALBOX-------

My main OS is Linux. I use VirtualBox to test on Windows and OSX. Here is my set-up.

On Linux machine
	apt-get install git-core
	cd into the root folder where pagesigner,  pagesigner-oracles and pagesigner-unittests are located
	git daemon --base-path=. --export-all --reuseaddr --informative-errors --verbose
	
In VirtualBox GUI add a network adapter in Bridged Mode.
From within Windows or OSX assign an IP address to this new adapter in the same subnet as the device the adapter is bridged with,
i.e. if in Linux my wlan3 interface IP is 192.168.0.103 then the new adapter's IP should be 192.168.0.*

From within the VirtualBox:
	install git (on Windows, dont choose to convert newlines) and run
	git clone git://192.168.0.103/pagesigner
	git clone git://192.168.0.103/pagesigner-oracles
	git clone git://192.168.0.103/pagesigner-unittests
	
Before running the test, you must git pull any changes.
